# Confidential-e_Degree-Repository-using-Blockchain

"Confidential e-Degree Repository using Blockchain" aims to provide a decentralized and transparent solution to manage degree issuing and validation process. The idea is implemented for a University having multiple affiliated colleges, or any entity managing degrees or certificates, to store degree/certificate validation proof on a blockchain system. This project currently uses Ethereum blockchain,and tested on Ropsten Testnet. Once a degree is committed on the blockchain, anyone is able to verify if the degree submitted to him is genuine or fake. For example, an employer/interviewer can verify qualification of  interviewee.

## Getting Started

Follow the below steps to get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. This project contain a decentralized web application to deploy degree record and validating a submitted degree.

## Prerequisites

* NodeJs installed
* MySQL
* Express Server
* Ropsten Testnet account with some test ethers

## Installing

* Download dependencies or copy them from folder- node_modules.
* Make a ropsten testnet account and request some test ethers in it from vault.
* Make 2 tables in MySQL, according to instructions given in sql.md file.

## Running the decentralized web application

* node server.js
* node validate.js
Then, visit:
* http://localhost:3000  //For deployment
* http://localhost:3001  //For validation
