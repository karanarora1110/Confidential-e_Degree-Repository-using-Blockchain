# Confidential-e_Degree-Repository-using-Blockchain

"Confidential e-Degree Repository using Blockchain" aims to provide a decentralized and transparent solution to manage degree issuing and validation process. The idea is implemented for a University having multiple affiliated colleges, or any entity managing degrees or certificates, to store degree/certificate validation proof on a blockchain system. This project currently uses Ethereum blockchain,and tested on Ropsten Testnet. Once a degree is committed on the blockchain, anyone is able to verify if the degree submitted to him is genuine or fake. For example, an employer/interviewer can verify qualification of  interviewee.
