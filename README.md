## Abstract

This project is part of the project requirement for the degree of B.Tech(Computer Science & Engineering). This project comprises two fundamental parts: the design and implementation of a decentralized application and this document, which is the technical part of the project. This work is based on research on Blockchain technology. 

Fake education certificates or fake degree is one of the major concerns in higher education. The fraud can be minimized if there is a tamper-proof and confidential registry of certificates wherein not one but multiple certified authorities verifies and stores the issued certificate in immutable repositories with proper privacy maintained. Secondly, there should be a mechanism for retrieving the authentic certificate without much cost and time.

The basic idea for choosing the only Blockchain as a solution is, Blockchain is a distributed database that has a set of blocks sorted chronologically. In those blocks, the information is stored in a full and consistent form. These features have been met because the blocks have a link between them so that it is not possible to perform any kind of alteration. The project is based on analysis on a use case applying the technology previously introduced.

"Confidential e-Degree Repository using Blockchain" aims to provide a decentralized and transparent solution to manage degree issuing and validation process. The idea is implemented for a University having multiple affiliated colleges, or any entity managing degrees or certificates, to store degree/certificate validation proof on a blockchain system. This project currently uses Ethereum blockchain and tested on Ropsten Testnet. Once a degree is committed on the blockchain, anyone is able to verify if the degree submitted to him is genuine or fake.

## Getting Started

Follow the below steps to get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. This project contains a decentralized web application to deploy degree record and validating a submitted degree.

## Prerequisites

* NodeJs installed
* MySQL
* Express Server
* Ropsten Testnet account with some test ethers

## Installing

* Download dependencies or copy them from folder- node_modules.
* Make a ropsten testnet account and request some test ethers in it from the vault.
* Make 3 tables in MySQL, according to instructions given in mysql.md file.

## Running the decentralized web application

On command prompt, type
* node server.js
* node validate.js

Then, visit:
* http://localhost:3000  //For deployment
* http://localhost:3001  //For validation

## Mentor

* Dr. Rekha Kashyap, Head, Deptt of Computer Science & Engineering, Inderprastha Engineering College.
